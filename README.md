VisualNexus is an open-source training pipeline designed to facilitate the segmentation and labeling of visual datasets using a single model. It allows you to generate richly detailed labeled datasets for downstream fine-tuning of models. With VisualNexus, you can streamline the process of data preparation and enhance the efficiency of training computer vision models.

## Key Features

- Seamless segmentation and labeling of visual datasets.
- Efficient data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
- Support for multiple input data formats.
- Richly detailed labeled datasets for downstream model training.
- Easy integration with existing computer vision workflows.
- Share with friends feature to spread awareness across various social media platforms.

## Architecture

VisualNexus employs a simple yet effective architecture to perform segmentation and labeling tasks. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Data Input**: VisualNexus accepts input visual datasets in various formats, including images, videos, or any other compatible data format.

2. **Segmentation and Labeling**: The dataset is processed using a pre-trained segmentation model, which accurately identifies and segments objects or regions of interest within the visuals. This step produces richly detailed labels for each data instance.

3. **Dataset Storage**: The labeled dataset is stored in a structured format, ensuring the preservation of original data along with the corresponding segmentation and labeling information. This format facilitates easy integration with downstream model training processes.

4. **Downstream Fine-tuning**: The generated labeled dataset can be seamlessly used for fine-tuning other computer vision models. The labeled data provides valuable annotations, enabling the models to learn from high-quality labeled examples and improve their performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with VisualNexus, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the VisualNexus repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/VisualNexus.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your visual dataset and place it in the designated input folder.

4. Run the VisualNexus pipeline:

```bash
python visualnexus.py
```

5. The labeled dataset will be stored in the specified output folder, ready for downstream fine-tuning.
